<em> A project by Brian Chin Ze Kang, Liu Tonghan, Ernest Ng Wei Jun, Seow Sin Kiat and Teo Wei Qing </em>
<p> Given the prevalence of the issue of textile wastes (as a result consumerism) and the decline in textile recycling recycling efforts, we seeked to tackle the issue through the invention of Stitch - the very first upcycling machine that is able to convert used textiles into resuable bags. Stitch comprises of 2 main components, namely the template and the heat stamping and cutting component. Both components are supplemented by other components such as the Graphic User Interface (GUI) and circuity.

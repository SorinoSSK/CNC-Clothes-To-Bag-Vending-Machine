## Heat Sealing Mechanism
This prototype is used as submission for 30.007 module due to it's success in binding fabric together and time constraint.

Heat sealing of fabric is performed with 2 criterial:
1) iron-on tape (purchased from iKea)
2) ironing with heatblock at 200°C

# Heat sealing experimentation
Before the adoption of the iron-on tape, our group conducted two experiments to determine the feasibility of binding the fabric by melting both layers of the clothing together. The melting temperature of polyester is approximately 260°C.
1) Melting with heat block. In this test, our group is unable to control the temperature when it reaches beyond 300°C. <br />

1.1) Insufficient heat and pressure. <br />
Low temperature sealing (~60°C below melting temperature) is usually applied to seal fabrics by pressure, according to our research. However, the heat did not permeate to the second layer of the fabric in our test, and thus the fabric did not hold together. As a result, our team came to the conclusion that because our prototype is made of plastic and thus we won't be able to apply enough pressure to seal the fabric.

1.2) Heating near melting temperature. <br />
We tried sealing the fabric around its melting temperature after low-temperature sealing failed. When the temperature reached 250°C, the fabric still did not seal. The fabric that is not in direct contact with the heat block is touched and found to be lukewarm rather than being near melting temperature. When the temperature reaches 260°C, however, the heat block pass straight through the fabric, leading the infeasibility of this method to be acknowledged.

2) Melting with point heat.
We moved on to the next test and tried to seal with a point heat, where heat is concentrated to a point rather than a block, as sealing with a heat block is difficult to control. In this approach, our group was able to control the temperature and bind two layers of fabric together at 250°C. However, even with prolonged heating, the fabric binding is too weak (point heated from 0 to 10 seconds). Therefore, the idea of direct sealing is being abandoned.

# Final heat sealing methodology 
The previous two approaches were too scrapped because to inconsistent pressure and unpredictable heat regulation, so we decided to finish our final design by adopting iron-on tape. Here are some snippets of the heat sealing mechanism:
1) Applying consistent heat and pressure to the iron-on tape.

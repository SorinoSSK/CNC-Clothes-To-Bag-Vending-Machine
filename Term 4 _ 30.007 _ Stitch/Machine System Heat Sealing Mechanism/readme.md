## Heat Sealing Mechanism
This prototype is used as submission for 30.007 module due to it's success in binding fabric together and time constraint.

Heat sealing of fabric is performed with:
1) heat tape (purchased from iKea)
2) ironing with heatblock at 200Â°C

<h2> Success of Mechanism </h2>
Here are some snippets of the heat sealing mechanism that underscores its success:

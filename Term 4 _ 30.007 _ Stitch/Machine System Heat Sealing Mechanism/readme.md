## Heat Sealing Mechanism
This prototype is used as submission for 30.007 module due to it's success in binding fabric together and time constraint.

Heat sealing of fabric is performed with 2 criterial:
1) iron-on tape (purchased from iKea)
2) ironing with heatblock at 200°C

# Heat sealing experimentation
Before the adoption of the iron-on tape, our group conducted two experiments to determine the feasibility of binding the fabric by melting both layers of the clothing together. The melting temperature of polyester is approximately 260°C.
1) Melting with heat block. In this test, our group is unable to control the temperature when it reaches beyond 300°C. <br />

1.1) Insufficient heat and pressure. <br />
Low temperature sealing (~60°C below melting temperature) is usually applied to seal fabrics by pressure, according to our research. However, the heat did not permeate to the second layer of the fabric in our test, and thus the fabric did not hold together. As a result, our team came to the conclusion that we won't be able to apply enough pressure to seal the fabric due to the innate material characteristics of fabric.

1.2) Heating near melting temperature. <br />
We tried sealing the fabric around its melting temperature after low-temperature sealing failed. Despite reaching 250°C, the fabric still did not seal. We touched the fabric that was not in direct contact with the heat block and found it to be lukewarm in temperature (rather than being near the melting temperature). When the temperature reached 260°C, the heat block passed straight through the fabric, underscoring the feasibility issues of this method.

2) Melting with point heat.
We moved on to the next test and tried to seal with a point heat, a method which involves concentrating heat to a point rather than a block. This method was undertaken because we recognised the difficulting of controlling a heat block and how point heating can allow for better control. Through this approach, our group was able to control the temperature and bind two layers of fabric together at 250°C. However, even with prolonged heating, the fabric binding formed was too weak (point heated from 0 to 10 seconds). Therefore, the idea of direct sealing was abandoned.

# Final heat sealing methodology 
The previous two approaches were scrapped too because to inconsistent pressure and unpredictable heat regulation, so we decided to finish our final design by adopting iron-on tape. Here are some snippets of the heat sealing mechanism:
1) Applying consistent heat and pressure to the iron-on tape.

## Decoupled CNC sewing mechanism
The team proposed the decoupled CNC sewing mechanism to undertake fabric sealing for the project initially, and it was constructed using an old mini sewing machine.
However, halfway through the project, the mechanism is abandoned due to design hiccups of the gantry. Sewing with a sewing machine requires precise needle and bobbin alignment, which the gantry mechanism could not deliver. <br />
Our group have performed multiple testing and tuning, and we have narrowed it down to three issues. <br />
1) The needle to hits the bobbin, causing both the needle and bobbin to jam.

2) The bobbin is too far from the needle causing the failure to hook the threads from the needle. <br />

3) The bobbin hits the needle causing the needle to bend and failure to hook the thread. <br />

The bending in the gantry triggers all three concerns, resulting in inaccuracy in the needle and bobbin alignment as it moves closer to the vending machine's center, circled in the image below.

Despite all of the failures, our team was able to consistently achieve 2 stitches from the machine, proving the decoupled sewing mechanism's feasibility. Our group believes that a stronger gantry will enhance the sewing mechanism's functionality.

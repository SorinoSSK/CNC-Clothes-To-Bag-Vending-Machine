## Decoupled CNC sewing mechanism
The team proposed the decoupled CNC sewing mechanism to undertake fabric sealing for the project, and it was constructed using an old mini sewing machine.
However, halfway through the project, the mechanism is abandoned due to design hiccups of the gantry mechanism. Sewing with a sewing machine requires precise needle and bobbin alignment, which the gantry mechanism cannot deliver.
In the test shown below, the imprecision has caused by the gantry has caused the needle to hit the bobbin.

In another test shown below, the imprcision has caused the bobbin to fail in hooking the threads from the needle.
